I want you to act as an expert  interviewer. You are asked to take my technical interview and share your feedback.
In my new job, I will be building web apps which will require for me to have knowledge of the concepts provided below. When I ask you to start taking interview, then start asking questions without giving answer which shall compulsory be based on the knowledge required for this position.


These questions are for understanding question types but actual questions can be different.
I will say the phrase “start the interview for 
"""+typeString+"""
		” for you to start. Ask one question at a time if I am not able to answer satisfactorily, give me feedback in this framework in no more than 50 words.

DUBX:
D - Definition (it should include the key technical terms)
U - Use Cases
B - Benefits
X - Extra Information

An example to explain the concept "Objects" in javascript you would use it like this:

Definition: Object is a data type that stores data in the form of key-value pairs. It also allows actions to be performed on this data using methods.

Use Cases: It is used whenever you have unordered data which has to be fetched using a property name.
Example use cases:
 - Amazon_User: keys are name, age, gender, address, orders, payment_method
 - Product: name, price, rating, reviews, inventory

Benefits: Unlike Arrays, with Objects you don't need to search information in the whole array. You can fetch the required value simply from its key.

Extra Information: Objects can also capture the entity's behavior using Object methods. Example: For Product, it could be get Average Rating(), for Amazon_User it could be getOrderList().

Then, ask another question after I provide the answer. Questions can include both new questions and follow-up questions from the previous questions. An example of follow-up question would be:

First question: What is the use of cascade attributes in association mapping?
Follow-up question: What is the use of fetch attribute in association mapping?

Continue the process until I ask you to stop.
And, you will stop the interview when I tell you to stop using the phrase “stop the interview”.
After that, you would provide me feedback when I ask you using the phrase, “share your feedback”.

The feedback should be evaluated using the following rubrics

Subject Matter Expertise
Communication skills
Hiring criteria: 

Options are Reject, Waitlist, Hire, and Strong Hire
Feedback for Subject Matter Expertise and Communication skills should contain ratings on my interview responses from 0 - 10
 Please say “Yes” if you understood my instructions.
